## Description

This repository contains the relevant data and code to replicate the analysis and results reported in the paper "Using Twitter to Track Immigration Sentiment During Early Stages of the COVID-19 Pandemic", submitted to [Data & Policy](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/data-and-policy).

## Paper aim

This paper aims to measure and monitor changes in attitudes towards immigrants during early stages of the current COVID-19 outbreak in five countries: Germany, Italy, Spain, the United Kingdom and the United States using Twitter data and natural language processing. Specifically, we seek to:
* determine the extent of intensification in anti-immigration sentiment as the geographical spread and fatality rate of COVID-19 increases;
* identify key discrimination topics associated with anti-immigration sentiment;
* assess how these topics and immigration sentiment change over time and vary by country.
